1. Created this repository using the GitHub guide and followed the guide (https://pages.github.com/) to get a website set up on GitHub Pages. Hopefully that has worked. Next I need to add an index file.

2. Created an index file! Website seems to work (lopezelpesado.github.io) and I think I've got the hang of Atom. I've been able to publish a change in the index file to make it say YO!!! I wanna make my website have an old computer terminal feel like in Alien and like my "Please stand by" card I made for my stream. I'll start by setting the background to black, changing the font to green and choosing a good font (hopefully I'll be allowed to use the font I use for my stream).

3. OK so when I make changes to a file I can press ctrl+s (save) and then my changes got to the Git panel as unstaged changes, I can then make them staged and then type a commit message, commit them to main and then push them to GitHub (I think that's how that works).

1. Matched the text colour with my Twitch channel. Will change the font to be more old school computer-y.

---

#### 8/1/21

1. Not many updates recently as I've been doing JS. Yvonne said that most people use VS Code so I'm using that now and am gunna test how that works. Will update the text on the website to try and get the hang of pushing from here.

#### 2/2/21

1. I've been digging into JavaScript and it's tricky! I'm gunna revise HTML and add to my website as I go back through the HTML challenges.

2. Just realised that this document is in markdown so I'm gunna now go through and edit it so that it displays properly.

---

#### 3/2/21

1. Continuing going back through the HTML challenges.

2. Added a picture of me :)

3. Added a bunch of stuff including lists, kittens and a form! Practicing this stuff is really helpful

---

#### 4/2/21

1. Still revising HTML challenges and practicing using the website, this time on my laptop

---

#### 5/2/21

1. Forgot to install GitHub Desktop on my laptop so wasn't able to commit/push yesterday ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Installed now and away my changes went!

2. I'll continue HTML relearning and try to add comments to the stuff I add that'll help me remember what stuff is for.

---

#### 8/2/21

1. Here we go again, revising HTML and adding to website.

2. Added some checkboxes and added some divs.

---

#### 9/2/21

1. Back at it again with HTML revision. Good news! Coaching is starting on Thursday!

---

#### 10/2/21

1. I am once again revising HTML and have moved on to CSS. Also added the breaks between days

---

#### 11/2/21

1. Today is Thursday and also the start of the coaching program! Gunna continue revising CSS and start by making my face round.

2. Having fun with CSS, made my about section look really pretentious.

3. Padding! Here we go, now I can hopefully make the website look a lot better

4. Switched font to VT323 which is more like the Alien: Isolation terminal font that I love

---

#### 12/2/21

1. First workshop yesterday was great, can't wait for the next one and to start working with everyone! For now, I will continue revising HTML and CSS on freeCodeCamp and try some projects on there too. Gregor mentioned not copying and pasting code but typing it out to aid learning so I will try and do that.

2. More padding, gunna try and set all the padding manually

3. Margins now, hopefully I can make the author bit look better with some margins, maybe if I put the text in a div separate to the box itself

4. Let's tidy up some margin and padding code with clockwise notation üïë

5. Now for some [attr=value] selectors, although it is throwing up errors when I used the notaion from freeCodeCamp here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-css/use-attribute-selectors-to-style-elements
I'll try it and see.

6. Weirdly the tutorial didn't seem to mention that you should specify which element to target so I'll try adding "input" to the start of the attribute selector

7. Scratch that, I'm an idiot. Would help if I got the syntax right, used an : instead of = ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

---

#### 17/2/21

1. Bit of a break there but I'm ready to get coding again. Will continue revising the freeCodeCamp challenges and adding to the website. Opened VS Code to find unsaved changes üò¨

2. That was weird, my index on VS was older than what was on GitHub. I think I've fixed it but will need to watch out for that in future.

3. WE've moved on to ABSOLUTE units and relative units now, gunna try using ems and mms and see what happens.

4. looks OK on PC but totally broken the author section on mobile, will have to fix

5. Now onto precedence in CSS: element < class < id, bottom < top, class < inline & finally !important is king

6. Colours! (or Colors!), I think I prefer hsl to hex or rgb

7. CSS variables sound cool, instead of setting a CSS property to a value you can set it to a variable and so you can set lots of different properties to the same variable and then
change them all at once by changing the variable's value, nice

8. Added a CSS variable for my stream colour

---

#### 18/2/21

1. It's tutorial day once again! And we're onto "Applied Visual Design"! Great! Hopefully my website will start to look a bit more design now

2. Shadows! I'm gunns try and get some glow on the Standby and picture

3. Shadows aren't working but I think it might be because I got rid of all borders and margins so I'm gunna uncomment them and see what happens

4. Fixed! Will need to revisit my messing around with borders. Also added shadow to the text

5. Text shadow isn't working so will have to figure that one out, will comment out for now

6. Will move on to revising the homework modules as Applied Visual Design is not on there, moving on to "Responsive Web Design Principles", will return to "Decrease the Opacity of an Element" later

7. Media queries first, will design for desktop with alternate styling for mobile

8. Gunna try flexing the bit with my face and about section, see what happens

9. now reverse it

#### 19/4/21

1. It's been 2 months and I've learnt so much. The coaching has been going great and I'm really enjoying working with other people again. Learning with others feels great. I feel like I've come along way, particularly with JavaScript. Now it's time to focus on my application website. I need to completely rework this website. I don't feel confident with CSS and laying things out nicely. I created a [simple tribute page](https://codepen.io/lopezelpesado/pen/ZELBbqv) which I'm really happy with but getting the different elements where I wanted them to go was very much a trial and error process. Tonight I am going to a meetup hosted by Founders and Coders (FAC) and I hope to be able to get some help with this. I'm going install live server too which is an extension which creates an auto refreshing view of your webpage. I also need to seperate out my CSS and start a JavaScript file so I'm gunna start by figuring that out. Let's go!

2. I've got my css into a seperate document and started a JavaScript document as well. I've added a button that I've tried to write some JS for but that doesn't seem to be working. I'm gunna now try and work on my initial retro layout

---

#### 28/4/21

1. Using live server and Chrome's console, you can see what's going on with your JavaScript which is super helpful. Need to remember to always console log and check!

2. I've been working on [a design for my application website](https://codepen.io/lopezelpesado/pen/MWJqGPe) and a [css image filter](https://codepen.io/lopezelpesado/pen/xxgQoMN) on CodePen and I'm really happy with the results so I'm gunna move it over to GitHub.
